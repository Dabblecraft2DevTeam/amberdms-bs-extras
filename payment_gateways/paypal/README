=========================

The Website Payments Standard PayPal service is the lowest-cost, simpliest solution
offered by PayPal.

Amberdms's sample code currently supports:
* Allowing customers to lookup and pay invoices
* IPN payment notification
* Support for paypal fees.

When a customer pays for an invoice using paypal, an IPN is sent from PayPal back to
your server.

This IPN is then processed and two things are changed in the billing system:
1. The payment is filed against the invoice.
2. A GL transaction is created for the paypal fees.
