AMBERDMS BILLING SYSTEM PAYMENT GATEWAYS
========================================

This directory contains open sources code for setting up payment gateways to allow
customers to pay invoices via credit card, paypal, etc.

In the future, it is planned to incorporate these features inside the Amberdms Billing
System itself, but the code here allows you to write more complex systems of your own.


All these payment gateways communicate with the Amberdms Billing System via it's SOAP
API, so you can integrate the payment code with your company website, whilst running the
Amberdms Billing System itself on a different server or private-only network.
