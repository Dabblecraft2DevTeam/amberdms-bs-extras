SERVICE USAGE COLLECTORS
========================

Service usage collectors are programs for uploading usage records into the
Amberdms Billing System, where the records are then used when generating service
invoices.

Note that the Amberdms Billing System will only bill on a daily basis, so there
is no use supplying hourly records, since they will just slow down database
queries.

A number of sample collectors have been supplied which you may use to collect
data:

* send_usage_records		General sample code collector template

* sent_netacct_records		Reads usage records from netacct and sends a
				daily summary.


Please refer to the Amberdms SOAP API and the Amberdms Service Usage Guide for
further information.
