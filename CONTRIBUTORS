CONTRIBTION INFORMATION
=======================

Unlike the main Amberdms Billing System codebase, the contents of the external
programs package are licensed under various different software licenses.


If you would like to contribute changes to this program - whether it is code,
documentation or alternate language support, please send it to either the project
development mailing list or directly to developers@amberdms.com.

Security issues should always be reported to security@amberdms.com so that
we can issue updates promptly to all users.

Amberdms will always public credit anyone who finds a security flaw or contributes
any other content.


The following are the requirements for getting your code included in this package.

1. All submissions must include either of the following:

	a) A copyright notice along with the license terms of your submission. If you
	   are modifying an existing program, Amberdms will only accept code under
	   the same license as the original program.

	b) If you don't care about the licensing, you can submit your code with the
	   following notice attached:

	  "I assign copyright ownership of this source code to Amberdms Ltd (New Zealand) to
	   use in anyway they see fit."

	   Amberdms will include the code and still give you credit for the change, but are
	   able to release your code in any way in future.


2. Amberdms can not accept any code which is covered by software patents - if you wish to
   submit patented technologies, Amberdms will only accept if all of the following are true:
   	
	a) You/your organisation owns the patent(s) in question.

	b) You issue a world-wide, irrevokable, royalty-free license for anyone using Amberdms
	   source code under an open source license (as defined by the OSI or FSF).

	c) The patented code must be clearly marked.



Please send all submissions to any of the following locations:

a) The development mailing list for the project - please see www.amberdms.com/billing for details.

b) security@amberdms.com (security issues only)

c) developers@amberdms.com (all other submissions)
